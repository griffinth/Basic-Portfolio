<p> Hello World! My name is Griffin Hume and I was born in Boston, MA. The majority of the time I lived in Somerville, MA. It was a small town and full of a variety of different housing districts.It was an incredibly diverse community and it will always hold a place in my heart.We lived in a house with my Grandma that my family has been in for years. I was always walking places or taking public transportation. It was the thing to do up there. After making friends and finishing elementary school I found out we were moving. I was young at the time I just didn’t want to leave the rest of my family. We moved to Charlotte because of my Moms’ job and my aunt came along too. It took some acclimating due to the complete opposite nature of the community down here. Everyone was actually kind to you. The weather was warm compared to the cold nature of the north, both the weather and the people. To be continued...</p>
